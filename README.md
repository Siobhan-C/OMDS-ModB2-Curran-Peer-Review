# Week 2 - Preprocessing, part 2


Preprocessing Data: Working with Your Own Data
Your homework assignment must be accessed using GitHub Classroom. 

Assignments will include a Weekly Graph Question, Exploratory Data Analysis using either your own datasets or the dataset provided, and recreating a graph from the Storytelling With Data (SWD) textbook.

Complete your work and answer any questions posed in the assignment directly in your Jupyter Notebook. You will turn in this weekly Jupyter Notebook with your Milestone Three assignment in Week 7.

Follow the link below to access the Jupyter Notebook containing this week’s homework assignment, “Preprocessing Data: Working with Your Own Data” in GitHub Classroom.

Download the file and rename your notebook according to the following naming convention: OMDS-ModB2-Week[#]-[Your last name]-[Your first name] For example, OMDS-ModB2-Week2-VonKorff-Joshua would be used for the Week 2 notebook. This naming convention will help you organize your notebooks when submitting them with your Milestone Three assignment. To receive credit, the Jupyter Notebook needs to run when it is graded.

We strongly encourage you to start your assignment as early as possible. This will give you more time to ask learning facilitators questions as needed.

This assignment will also be submitted for peer review and feedback in Week 3.
